# 🚀 About the Project

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their symbols ("X" or "O"). The goal is to be the first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Building this project helped me:

Implement game logic and win conditions in JavaScript

Practice DOM manipulation and interactive UI updates

Handle turn-based gameplay and real-time scoring

Build a responsive and clean interface
